              <p class="title">From Legal to Tech</p>
              <p>A long dream of mine was to become a laywer and deffend the wrongly accused, the underprivileged, and the Constitution. But lawschool is expensive. So, to determine if law school was the right choice for me, I became a Paralegal. I practiced for four years in the Personal Injury and Construction Deffect areas. It helped me realize this wasn't the career I wanted to pursue for the rest of my life. I felt trapped in the monotonous legal field, until I discover Web and Software Development.</p>
              <p>Studying code was slow and confusing. Coupled with everyday responsibilities, learning on my own was quite difficult. I then had the opportunity to join LEARN Academy, a San Diego Ruby on Rails bootcamp, where I became a Jr. Full Stack Web Developer. </p>
              <p>LEARN Academy is one of the best decisions I've made. It has open endless possibilities and is a career where I can create and help the world become a better place. I look forward to continue to grow, learn, and help the world through tech development.</p>

              <p>Club America; The greatest Mexican football club. My weekends are planned around their schedule, which annoys my girlfriend. I have followed this team since I was in 3rd grade, and let me tell you....we've been through a lot. Just last year we lost the final against Tigres (Tigers). It still hurts. We've made it to the playoffs nine consecutive tournaments and we're on track to make it ten.</p>
              <p> As a kid, I played soccer every single day. I joined several teams, but never won a championship. As I grew older, other responsibilities took precedence and with time, I got out of shape. I'm currently trying to get back in shape to join a local team.</p>

              <p>There's something about a cup of tea that's really relaxing, but I can't never quite put my finger on it. It is perhaps that mysteriousness that attracts me. A warm cup of tea helps me put my thoughts together and relaxes me after a long, stressful day.</p>
              <p>Earl Grey is my favorite. It's bold flavor and delicious smell is unsurpassable. </p>

              <p class="title">Calligraphy for the soul</p>
              <p>It all started when Audrey Lozano, a classmate in 8th grade, wrote in beautiful cursive, the word "little". I was hypnotised by how perfect and elegant the letters flowed. I too wanted to write that bueatifully, so I changed my handwriting to cursive.</p>
              <p>Eventually, I discovered the world of calligraphy and the history of letter design. I started practicing with pencils and pens and just recently bought my first fountain pen. I'm still learning how to use it, but I'm sure I'll become really good soon. </p>

              <p>The Gentlemen's drink. Nothing like the bold taste of whisky on the rocks to think, meditate, or converse with close friends. Glenlivet, McCarran, and Buchanan's are among my favorites. I know there are better out there, but this palate is young and still discovering whisky's from all over the world</p>
